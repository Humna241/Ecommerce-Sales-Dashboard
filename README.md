# Ecommerce-Sales-Dashboard 

**Project overview: E-commerce Dashboard to improve sales**

An interactive E-commerce Sales Dashboard (Power BI) that tracks year-to-date (YTD) performance and lets you slice results by customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) and city. It surfaces:

--> Executive KPIs (YTD Sales and YTD Profit with YoY deltas and trend).

--> Category performance (Office Supplies, Technology, Furniture) with YTD vs PYTD and trend.

--> Geographic view (sales by state + regional share).

--> Product drill-downs (top/bottom performers by YTD sales).

--> Operations view (sales mix by shipping type).



**Key Insights:**

1. YTD sales are decreasing while YTD profit is increasing.  Products that are selling less but generating more revenue .so, focus on such products that are generating more revenue.


2. We perform well in previous year sales (2021) in office supplies and technology while current year (2022) can't differentiate more in both but a little bit in Furniture category.


3. Staple envelop , staples  and easy-staple paper are the most revenue generating categories from office supplies .To increase more sales on these products run adds with coupons and do social media marketing.


4. Eldon jumbo profile boxes are the lowest generating sales product among them. Minimize its stock.


5. West and east region performing very well in generating sales followed by central while south is lagging behind.


6. Most people prefer standard class do not preferring first class and second class. They do not hurry & does not want to pay extra money for early shipment. Resulting they do not trust on products .


7. Make some strategy to urge people for second class shipment for more revenue.
